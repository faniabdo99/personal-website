                      Clear Browser Cache in React
                      To clear browser cache in React, we can add meta tags inside the head tag to make sure that the content of the page isn’t cached.

                      For instance, we put:
                      in the head tag to set the cache-control response reader to no-cache.

                      And the expires response header is set to 0 to make sure nothing is cached.

                      Clear Browser Cache in React
                      To clear browser cache in React, we can add meta tags inside the head tag to make sure that the content of the page isn’t cached.

                      For instance, we put:
                      in the head tag to set the cache-control response reader to no-cache.

                      And the expires response header is set to 0 to make sure nothing is cached.

                      Conclusion
